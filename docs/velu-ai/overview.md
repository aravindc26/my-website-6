## What is Velu AI?

Velu AI is an autonomous documentation assistant designed to keep product knowledge accurate across fast-moving SaaS organizations. It continuously ingests product signals from tools such as Slack, GitHub, Linear, Confluence, and Google Drive, then synthesizes them into structured help articles, release notes, onboarding flows, and technical guides. By operating as the "documentation brain" of the company, Velu AI monitors changes, detects stale content, drafts updates, and routes them for review or automated publishing.

## Why Velu AI matters

* **Eliminates stale content:** Targets fewer than 5% of documents falling behind the latest product release.
* **Automates manual work:** Aims for at least 70% automation of documentation updates, shrinking the effort required from writers and product teams.
* **Accelerates release-to-docs velocity:** Reduces the time to publish accurate documentation updates to within 24 hours of a feature change.
* **Improves customer outcomes:** Strives for 95% coverage of user tasks so support and success teams can resolve issues quickly.

## Who is Velu AI for?

* **Technical writers** who need help enforcing style, consistency, and completeness across sprawling doc sets.
* **Product managers** who want documentation to reflect roadmap changes without constant manual coordination.
* **Developers** who rely on up-to-date API references, onboarding guides, and implementation notes that stay aligned with code.
* **Support and customer success teams** who require fresh FAQs and troubleshooting steps that mirror recurring customer questions.
* **Early-stage founders** who must provide professional documentation before they can staff a dedicated writing team.

## Core capabilities

* **Context ingestion:** Captures conversations, tickets, specs, repositories, and rich media across Slack, Zendesk, Linear/Jira, Confluence, Notion, and more.
* **Autonomous updates:** Flags outdated pages, rewrites or drafts new content with hallucination controls, and proposes diffs for human approval when needed.
* **Publishing workflows:** Pushes updates into established doc platforms (Markdown repos, Confluence, Notion, Mintlify, GitBook, Paligo) while tracking edit history and rollback options.
* **Interaction interfaces:** Powers Slack slash commands, a GitHub PR assistant mode, a Chrome capture extension (roadmap), and an "Ask Velu" chat experience for on-demand drafting.
* **Governance and safety:** Supports role-based approvals, confidence scoring, audit logs, and data-privacy safeguards suitable for SOC 2-conscious teams.

## What to expect next

Phase 1 targets a Q1Q2 2026 launch with the foundational ingestion, automation, and publishing workflows. Future phases expand into autonomous UI recording for "how-to" guides, personalized documentation per customer version, and eventually a fully continuous documentation engine that requires little to no manual intervention.
